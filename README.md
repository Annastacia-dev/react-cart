# Implementing Cart Functionality in React JS

## Introduction
In this tutorial, we will be implementing a cart functionality in React JS. We will be using React Hooks to manage the state of the cart. We will be using the Context API to pass the cart state to the components that need it. We will be using the Local Storage API to persist the cart state in the browser.We will also be using Tailwind CSS to style our application.

## Prerequisites
To follow along with this tutorial, you will need to have the following installed on your machine:
- Node.js
- npm

## Getting Started
To get started, we will create a new React application using vite. To do this, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm create vite@latest
```

You will be prompted to enter the name of your project. Enter the name of your project and press enter. In this tutorial, we will be naming our project `react-cart`. You will also be prompted to select a framework. Select `React` and press enter. You will also be prompted to select a variant. Select `Javascript` and press enter. This will create a new React application in a folder named `react-cart`. To start the application, navigate to the `react-cart` folder and run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the application in development mode. You can now open the application in your browser by navigating to `http://localhost:5173`.

## Installing Tailwind CSS
To install Tailwind CSS, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss@latest postcss@latest autoprefixer@latest
```
```bash
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

This will create a `tailwind.config.js` file in the root of your project. Open the `tailwind.config.js` file and add the following code to it:

```js
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

Next, let's clean up the `index.css` file in the `src` folder. Open the `index.css` file and remove all the code in it. Next, add the following code to the `index.css` file:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

Let's also clear up the `App.jsx` file in the `src` folder so that it looks like this:

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <>
    </>
  )
}
```
You can also delete the `App.css` file in the `src` folder.
